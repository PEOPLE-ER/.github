The Pioneer Earth Observation apPlications for the Environment (PEOPLE) ER project financed by the European Space Agency (ESA) is a trailblazer project to develop innovative high-quality EO-based application products, indicators, and methods, targeting ER research and development (R&D) priorities.

You will be able to find the repositories for this project's tools and tutorials pinned.

**PEOPLE-ER** is led by **[Hatfield Consultants](https://www.hatfieldgroup.com)** – a science-driven service-oriented company that builds solutions to complex environmental challenges, with a depth of experience in ER projects in Canada 
and around the world. Hatfield is a trusted partner for the development of cutting-edge and practical EO technologies.

_The PEOPLE-ER consortium includes_:

- **VTT** – the remote sensing team at VTT Technical Research Centre of    Finland produces EO data processing chains for domestic and international users.The team is internationally known, particularly for its forest monitoring applications and the Forestry TEP cloud processing platform. VTT is ranked among the leading European Research and Technology Organisations (RTO).

_The Early Adopters are_:

- **National Institute for Research and Development in Forestry (INCDS) (Romania)** – formally a member of the consortium, INCDS is the main organisation of research and development in forestry from Romania. INCDS is in charge for the forest resources assessment and monitoring.

- **IUCN (Vietnam)** – established in 1948, IUCN is an international authority working on a wide range of themes related to nature conservation, forests, ecosystem management, protected areas, global policy and governance and rights.

- **African Parks Network (APN)** – APN is a leading non-profit conservation organisation that takes on the complete responsibility for the rehabilitation and long-term management of national parks across Africa in partnership with governments and local communities.

- **Society for Ecosystem Restoration in northern British Columbia (SERNbc) (Canada)** – a key enabler for ER in forested ecosystems affected by cumulative disturbances from forest operations, energy exploration, wildfires, and forest pests/diseases.
  
- **Natural Resources Institute (Luke) (Finland)** – as one of the biggest clusters of bioeconomy expertise in Europe, Luke develops knowledge-based solution models and services for renewable natural resources management and supports decision-making in society.
